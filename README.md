The intension is to use this site as a repository of knowledge, each of us contributing knowledge we gain during the research process for the benefit of all lab members, present and future. Many of our projects require that we learn the same software and protocols, so why re-invent the wheel? Taking five minutes to add protocols, code, or lab-lifehacks to this page benefits you and Lin-Vasavada lab members for years to come.
